Quest Project Description:

An attendance tracking system for quest children fellowship.
The system consists of a database containing information about all the children, ie Name, Date of birth, Age, Parent's Name, Parent's contacts and Residence.

On a day being used, it's supposed to record the current date, then if a child's record is in the database, the system marks attendance by allowing the user to record a card number. There are physical cards handed to the parents used to sign out.

On signing out the systems operator should search for the card number, then signs that child out.

There are two classes divided by age, but the sign in and sighn out is the same.
